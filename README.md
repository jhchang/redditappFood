I based my app from this guy's webpage.

Below are a list of improvements that I made to the program:

I improved his design in multiple ways. 
It now can work on any webpage and doesn't crash when the program is used on other subreddits that contains text posts. This app is now adapted to work on any subreddit. 

This app also grabs the highest resolution possible for the preview. 

The upvotes are now automatically refershed to reflect the live state of the upvotes on the post. 

New posts that hit the front page are now added to the html page in addition to the posts that were there upon launching the app.
